        "Velocation, the bike-rental operator based in Paris, was very satisfied with the work you completed in the previous assignments. As a result, they have once again requested your assistance to help optimize their logistics network of 48 bike rental stations. Unlike the earlier assignments, this one introduces a multi-period setting: the distribution of bikes across all rental stations at the end of each day becomes the starting distribution for the following day. By designing an efficient nightly rebalancing strategy, you will aim to optimize the overall performance of Velocation’s bike-sharing network. To support this analysis, you are provided with data, described below, that is similar to Assignment 3.\n"

        "Having established that some degree of rebalancing may be necessary, your next task is to design efficient strategies to redistribute the 1248 bikes during the night. To gradually build toward your final solution, address the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What would be the ideal starting distribution of bikes at the beginning of the day to maximize the service level? In other words, if there were no constraints on the rebalancing operations, how would you allocate the bikes accross the stations?\n",
        "2. In practice, the number of bikes that can be moved overnight is limited. Assume that Velocation operates vans, each with a capacity of 30 bikes per night, regardless of the number of pick-up and drop-off locations. How much can the service level be improved by adding one, two, three, or more vans?\n",
        "3. Using vans is costly, as are multiple stops for pick-up and drop-off operations. For Velocation, the fixed cost to deploy a van is €50 per night. Additionally, each stop at a station (for either pick-up or drop-off) incurs an extra cost of €10. Each van can move at most 30 bikes per night. Your task is to design a rebalancing strategy that achieves an average service level of at least 95% while minimizing the average operational cost per night. Implement this strategy as a function that takes the end-of-day bike distribution (formatted as a list) as input and outputs a matrix indicating, for each element `[i,j]`, the number of bikes transferred from station *i* to station *j* during the night. Use clear visuals to present and interpret your final results."
